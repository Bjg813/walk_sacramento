Large utility poles in the center of already narrow sidewalks further minimize the available pedestrian zone. The lack of bike lanes makes bicycling difficult inboth directions along Norwood. ","Norwood Avenue is a major barrier to students walking and biking to school safely. The lack of midblock and marked crosswalks across the 5 vehicle lanes causes students cross in unyielding traffic, or for parents to simply disallow their student to walk or bike to school. Additionally, sidewalks are narrow and often encroached upon by overgrown shrubbery and fallen fences. Large utility poles in the center of already narrow sidewalks further minimize the available pedestrian zone. The lack of bike lanes makes bicycling difficult in both directions along Norwood. High traffic speeds further contribute to a poor pedestrian and bicycle environment. Vehicle oriented lighting and a lack of shade trees makes active transportation less safe and less appealing. A few roadway improvements along Norwood Avenue between Silver Eagle Road and Grand Avenue (a major bike and pedestrian corridor) would significantly improve the active transportation environment.

‰Û¢ The lanes on Norwood Avenue are approximately 12ft. wide. Narrowing lane width to 10 or
11ft. would provide the benefit of slowing traffic and creating room for bicycle and/or
pedestrian facilities.
‰Û¢ The left turn lane spans this entire corridor, yet only provides access to a few turns. Installing a
landscaped center median with turn pockets at intersections would further constrict motorists‰Ûª
line of sight, helping to further slow traffic. The medians would provide much needed shade,
sun shielding, and potential refuge areas for midblock crossings.
‰Û¢ The sidewalks along Norwood are narrow, cracked, and directly adjacent to roadway traffic.
Furthermore, pedestrians require a ‰ÛÏshy distance‰Û from fixed objects such as walls and fences.
The lack of a shy distance means that the effective walking width is reduced. Landscaping the
overgrown shrubbery and setting back fences and walls will enhance the walking environment.
Also, detached sidewalks with landscaped buffers further separate pedestrians from vehicles
and can provide the benefit of shade.
‰Û¢ Striped and signed bike lanes, in coordination with traffic calming and roadway narrowing
efforts would significantly improve the bikeability along this corridor. Additionally, striping,
bollards, or curbs that help to separate cyclists from roadway traffic would further improve
bicycle safety.
‰Û¢ The lack of pedestrian scale lighting makes active transportation less secure, especially in winter
months when sunlight is limited. Additional pedestrian lighting will improve safety and security.
‰Û¢ The majority of existing bus stops are simply signs on poles. Bus shelters that include seating

Significant congestion around schools can be harmful for a number of reasons including increased local air pollution from idling, frustrated motorists who may make rash decisions, and poor visibility of pedestrians. The congestion at Del Paso Heights Elementary School is in part due to teachers, administrators, and parents parking along Morey Avenue, significantly narrowing the roadway. Due to the lack of curb space, the school bus has been observed letting students out in the middle of the street. Furthermore, views of pedestrians are blocked by vehicles parked or idling at or just before crossing locations and driveways. Finally, because the majority of curbs at this location are rolled curbs, vehicles are often parked partially on the sidewalk, narrowing the available walking space. To ease traffic flow, improve bus drop off and pick up, improve visibility of pedestrians, and ensure ample walking room, parking should be restricted along Morey Avenue, especially during pick up and drop off periods. Doing so will of course require the designation of a nearby parking area for staff (see recommendation #8). The lack of on-street parking will allow parents and the school bus to quickly pick up or drop of their students at the curb, increase visibility at crossings and driveways, and increase the available walking area by removing over-parked vehicles",,Del Paso Heights Elementary School ,Del Paso Heights Elementary School off of Morsey towards the front of the school. ,Yes,,,,04/27/0015,,,Tahoe Park Neighborhood Association (3),,"Upgrade this crossing to an RRFB crossing

Relocate the pedestrian crossing sign to be more visible to motorists",,"Between 65th Street and this crosswalk at 62nd Street (a distance of 1,445 ft.) there are no marked pedestrian crossings nor any traffic controls. From a driver yield survey at this intersection, only 18 of 100 (18%) of drivers yielded for a pedestrian. A combination of high speeds, a fear that because of higher speeds a driver may be rear-ended if they yield, and poor visibility of pedestrians may be contributing to this lack of compliance.

As stated above, flashing beacon crosswalks have been proven to increase driver yield rates at crosswalks when compared to traditionally marked crosswalks. Additionally, the enhanced crossing may induce motorists to slow as they enter the more pedestrian focused area of Broadway between 61st and 57th Streets.

The pedestrian crossing sign is difficult to see when traveling westbound on Broadway. The sign is located behind a wide utility pole and under a large shade tree. According to the FHWA, pedestrian signs are important for indicating potential pedestrian presence to motorists and increasing rates of yielding.[v]",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6So69rLSfMzajkyM0s0UXBKRm50a1ZrVXhIS1pkLXM2aExR/view,,62nd Street and Broadway,Yes,,,,,,,grn_starsTahoe Park Neighborhood Association (1),Traffic Calming,"Implement a Complete Streets, traffic calming retrofit within the existing right-of-way.","‰Û¢ ADT >14,000 - restrict parking

Due to the misalignment of 58th at Broadway, all north-south trips must travel for a distance on Broadway. Due to the lack of a dedicated turn lane, motorist continuing on 58th either wait for a break in both direction of traffic to make a rapid two-stage turn, or cause traffic to back-up as they wait to turn left. Adding to this situation are two driveways at the corner gas station that add additional vehicles onto Broadway. This combination of issues has led to vehicles failing to yield for pedestrians crossing Broadway and near-collisions as motorists try to navigate the intersection.

To increase the rate of yielding at this intersection and to improve visibility of pedestrians, an RRFB should be installed. According to the Federal Highway Administration, RRFBs can enhance safety by reducing crashes between vehicles and pedestrians. RRFBs are a lower cost alternative to traffic signals and hybrid signals that are shown to increase driver yielding behavior at crosswalks significantly when compared to standard pedestrian crossing markings. At the intersection of Broadway and 58th there are no marked crossings or signs. The cost of an RRFB is approximately $10,000 to $15,000 for purchase and installation of two units with solar panels for powering the units.iv

According to City of Sacramento traffic engineers, the City typically no longer approves smaller parcels

with four driveways. Thus, an opportunity exists to negotiate with either the existing or future tenant

Pedestrian scale lighting is closer to the ground and spaced closely together creating an even lighting of the sidewalk instead of alternating bright and dark spaces. Human-scale lighting addresses actual safety concerns, both personal and traffic related, as well as the perception of safety to encourage more walking and biking.
